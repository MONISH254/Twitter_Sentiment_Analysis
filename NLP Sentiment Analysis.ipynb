    "## 1.1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on analyzing public sentiment from Tweets regarding Apple and Google products. The main goal is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can classify the sentiment of a Tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data, sourced from [CrowdFlower](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions), contains over 9,000 Tweets labeled by human raters. By analyzing this data, the model will help Apple and Google better understand customer perceptions of their products, allowing them to make informed decisions for marketing, customer service, and product development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by preprocessing the Tweets, transforming them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models, and training several classification algorithms to evaluate their performance.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Business Problem:\n",
    "Public perception of tech products can heavily influence a company's sales, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty. For companies like Apple and Google, understanding how customers feel about their products can provide valuable insights into areas for improvement, marketing strategies, and product development. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to develop a model that automatically classifies the sentiment of Tweets regarding Apple and Google products as positive, negative, or neutral. This can help companies quickly gauge public sentiment at scale, providing actionable insights for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders:\n",
    "- **Apple and Google Product Teams:** Use sentiment data to improve products and address customer pain points.\n",
    "- **Marketing Departments:** Tailor campaigns to target sentiment-driven messaging.\n",
    "- **Customer Support Teams:** Identify negative feedback more quickly to address concerns.\n",
    "- **Executives/Decision Makers:** Gain a high-level view of public opinion, enabling better strategic planning.\n"

    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project comes from [CrowdFlower](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions), containing over 9,000 Tweets. Each Tweet has been labeled by human raters with one of three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neither. The dataset contains the following key columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of the Dataset:\n",
    "- **Text**: The actual content of the Tweet, which we will analyze for sentiment classification.\n",
    "- **Brand/Product**: The specific product or brand mentioned in the Tweet, such as `iPhone`, `Google`, or `iPad`.\n",
    "- **Emotion**: The sentiment label, representing whether the sentiment expressed in the Tweet is `Positive emotion`, `Negative emotion`, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Variable:\n",
    "- **Emotion**: This will be the target variable, as it captures the sentiment associated with each Tweet.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of sentiments in the dataset, identify any patterns, and visualize key aspects of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Development**: Implement and train various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes) to classify the sentiment of Tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, especially focusing on multiclass classification metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterative Improvement**: Based on initial results, refine the models by incorporating advanced techniques such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or using pre-trained embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: Summarize the findings, discuss the model's effectiveness, and provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders based on the analysis.\n"
