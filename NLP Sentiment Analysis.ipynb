    "\n",
    "This project focuses on analyzing public sentiment from Tweets regarding Apple and Google products. The main goal is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can classify the sentiment of a Tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data, sourced from [CrowdFlower](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions), contains over 9,000 Tweets labeled by human raters. By analyzing this data, the model will help Apple and Google better understand customer perceptions of their products, allowing them to make informed decisions for marketing, customer service, and product development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by preprocessing the Tweets, transforming them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models, and training several classification algorithms to evaluate their performance.\n"

    "Public perception of tech products can heavily influence a company's sales, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty. For companies like Apple and Google, understanding how customers feel about their products can provide valuable insights into areas for improvement, marketing strategies, and product development. \n",

    "- **Apple and Google Product Teams:** Use sentiment data to improve products and address customer pain points.\n",
    "- **Marketing Departments:** Tailor campaigns to target sentiment-driven messaging.\n",
    "- **Customer Support Teams:** Identify negative feedback more quickly to address concerns.\n",
